Game idea
My game idea is to create something that involves a scrolling game. A collective goal where to gain points by eating something. Having a nice green environment.

Scenario and characters description (include placeholder graphics, drafts, references)
References would be like Mario Bros. or Cuphead. Placeholder would be like a dragon trying to collect coins and fruits.

Charactersâ€™ actions and goals
Characters that has up, down, left, and right movement. Goals are to collect points to win by either fighting or avoiding enemies.

Game Win/Lose conditions
You win by finishing the end and lose by getting hit by enemies.

Progression of levels
There is only one level.

Sources of inspiration (other games, movies, etc. that inspired your idea)
Mario bros., hollow knight.

What skills/interests you are looking for in a team mate
Skills I require from a teammate are graphical skills, animation skills, basic coding skills.
